# TODO

1. Consolidate the findings into a webpage so you can recommend a team for a given starter based on the wisdom of crowds.

2. Start with a pokemon then build outward from there. For example pick a starter then recommend the next pokemon to pick based on a few criteria.

3. Not currently pulling in types from the API. We should probably do that for better visualization.

4. The graph is not normalized based on evolutions so different evolutions are treated as separate nodes.

5. Edges are not labeled with weights

6. Allow toggling based on trade/no-trade

7. Augment using Smogon tiers, or just the in-game tiers...
