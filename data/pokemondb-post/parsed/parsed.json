You can replace Giga Drain later for Leaf Storm or Leaf\n                          Blade if you want Sceptile to be fully physical, but Giga Drain is\n                          really useful early on. If you ever need Giga Drain again, you can\n                          reteach it; you don't have that option if you let Treecko evolve at L16.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Other moves are pretty standard. Sceptile has a nice physical\n                          movepool, so it's highly viable to have Leaf Storm as your sole special\n                          move and 3 other physical moves to allow Sceptile to stay in after using\n                          Leaf Storm. Other good moves you can consider are Brick Break,\n                          X-Scissor, Power-Up Punch and False Swipe (to catch Pokemon).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"image\" src=\"What%20is%20a%20good%20in-game%20team%20for%20Omega%20Ruby%20and%20Alpha%20Sapphire%20%20-%20Pok%C3%A9Base%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Answers_files/linoone.jpg\"/>\n  <br/>\n  Linoone\n  <br/>\n  Ability: Pick Up\n  <br/>\n  - Cut\n  <br/>\n  - Strength\n  <br/>\n  - Rock Smash\n  <br/>\n  - Headbutt\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hoenn = Linoone\n  <br/>\n  Linoone = Pick Up\n  <br/>\n  Pick Up = free crap\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lets be honest, what Hoenn team is complete without Linoone. Aside\n                          from giving you free stuff, Linoone also doubles as a pretty good HM\n                          user, and a decent battle Pokemon with only Headbutt. Of course Ghost is\n                          a problem, but if your entire team is wiped and Linoone is your only\n                          surviving Pokemon, you're in serious trouble anyway. If you really want\n                          to, you can replace Headbutt with Surf for another HM move, or Shadow\n                          Claw for better coverage. You can delete all HM moves once at the E4 and\n                          Linoone is good to deal with Phoebe.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"image\" src=\"What%20is%20a%20good%20in-game%20team%20for%20Omega%20Ruby%20and%20Alpha%20Sapphire%20%20-%20Pok%C3%A9Base%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Answers_files/tentacruel.jpg\"/>\n  <br/>\n  Tentacruel @ Black Sludge\n  <br/>\n  Ability: Clear Body/ Liquid Ooze\n  <br/>\n  - Surf\n  <br/>\n  - Sludge Wave\n  <br/>\n  - Waterfall/ Dazzling Gleam\n  <br/>\n  - Dive/ Ice Beam\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can get Tentacruel pretty easily and early on, and it'll serve as\n                          good HM slave for all the water you need to deal with in Hoenn.

Thunderbolt is your Electric STAB move, Flash Cannon is your Steel STAB\nmove, Thunder Wave cripples opponents and can help with Magnezone's bad speed,\nand Charge Beam can buff up their Special Attack so they can tear through\nteams.\n\n![](What%20is%20a%20good%20in-\ngame%20team%20for%20Omega%20Ruby%20and%20Alpha%20Sapphire%20%20-%20Pok%C3%A9Base%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Answers_files/weezing.gif)  \nWeezing @ Metronome  \nAbility - Levitate\n\n  * Sludge Bomb (Level 34) \n  * Flamethrower (TM35 - Victory Road) \n  * Dark Pulse (TM97 - Team Magma/Aqua Hideout) / Shadow Ball (TM30 - Mt.

Share turned off, I\ndecided having bulky Pok\u00e9mon would be a good idea, and while Weezing might not\nbe as good as Aggron or Skarmory, I already had a Steel-type, I decided\nWeezing would be a good addition to the team. Weezing has pretty good moves,\npretty good stats, and good defensive typing, which paired with Levitate,\nmakes it a great Physical Wall. Sludge Bomb is STAB, Flamethrower is just for\nsome coverage, Dark Pulse/Shadow Ball covers his only weakness: Psychic, and\nWill-O-Wisp/Infestation/Toxic is for chip damage, adding to his wall-y role.\n\n![](What%20is%20a%20good%20in-\ngame%20team%20for%20Omega%20Ruby%20and%20Alpha%20Sapphire%20%20-%20Pok%C3%A9Base%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Answers_files/kecleon.gif)  \nKecleon @ Expert Belt  \nAbility - Colour Change / Protean (H)\n\n  * Slash (Level 25) \n  * Shadow Sneak (Level 7 - May require Move Reminder) \n  * Brick Break (TM31 - Sootopolis City) \n  * Aerial Ace (TM40 - Mauville City Pok\u00e9mart) \n\n> When I first got into Pok\u00e9mon a while ago, Kecleon was my favourite Pok\u00e9mon,\nbecause Chameleons were and still are my animals, so no doubt I loved Kecleon,\nespecially since I Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team as one of my first\nPok\u00e9mon games. Anyway, Kecleon may seem like an odd choice, but it is\nsurprisingly solid. He has amazing Special Defence and good Attack, and a\npretty great movepool. The moveset listed above was just the one I went with,\nbut you have plenty of options for experimentation. Slash is STAB and has a\nhigh critical rate, Shadow Sneak gives him priority (and turns him into a\nGhost-type with Protean, covering his Fighting weakness), and Brick Break and\nAerial Ace are just for further coverage (or type-transformation with\nProtean). **If you want Protean, catch the required Kecleon so you can DexNav\nfor a Protean Kecleon, however if you don't have the time to get Protean, just\ncatch the first one, and SR for a good nature. I would recommend Protean as it\ngives him STAB on every attack, but Colour Change is still useful in a lot of\ncases. Getting Protean was one of the things I was actually patient enough\nfor.**\n\n",

pulse/dragon claw/dual chop, although only available post game \ndragon pulse is the best dragon move or it but since its not easily \navailable dual chop or dragon caw will do\n  <br/>\n  rock slide/hidden power rock if lucky, coverage move for 2 of sceptle megas weaknesses\n  <br/>\n  focus blast/false swipe, false swipe to help catch stuff but focus blast\n is a great power move and with

abilty-thick fat\n  <br/>\n  having a 4x weakness to ice on the team a fighting type with thick fat will destroy any ice types\n  <br/>\n  moveset\n  <br/>\n  close combat, great move\n  <br/>\n  brick break/strength/ brick break can be a good stab move and doesn't \nget the def drops that close combat has and gets more pp, strength for a\n strength user and its an ok move\n  <br/>\n  knock off. great move weakness coverage and knocks off item\n  <br/>\n  fake out/rock slide/power up punch if didn't give brick break. fake out \nfor some damage, rock slide goes well on it and covers weakness and \npower up punch can raise attack\n </p>\n <p>\n  if you do use this when training it after obtaining at granite cave \ngoe back to the cave with all the wishmur and train on them, they will \ngive off hp evs and it can easily beat them\n </p>\n <p>\n  manectric@magnet or life orb or specs, although hard to obtain, life \norb can be gotten off wild absol and also you could have it as a mega \nbut its pre good as is abilty lightning rod/ static\n  <br/>\n  moveset\n  <br/>\n  volt switch, great damage and switch\n  <br/>\n  discharge/thunderbolt, thunderbolt is the better move but discharge is \namazing if used in doucle battle with mega sceptile giving it a spc \nattack boost and damaging the other enemys\n  <br/>\n  flamethrower, great move\n  <br/>\n  always try for hidden power ice but other wise thunder wave to catch stuff and para an enemy\n </p>\n <p>\n  sharpedo as a surfer if you want the faster surfing but other wise I would recommend walrien or milotic\n  <br/>\n  walrien@leftovers ability- thick fat\n  <br/>\n  moveset\n  <br/>\n  ice beam, powerful stab\n  <br/>\n  surf, stab and hm\n  <br/>\n  yawn, if you can be bothered breeding it if not eq for

ice beam\n  <br/>\n  water fall\n  <br/>\n  dragon pulse/dive\n </p>\n <p>\n  banette@banettite this Pokemon is a monster after it mega evolves, \nhaving 1 of the highest attack stats in the game and stab priority move \nabilty frisk-prankster\n  <br/>\n  moveset\n  <br/>\n  shadow sneak, priority\n  <br/>\n  shadow claw, sometimes shadow sneak isn't enough\n  <br/>\n  knock off, good move\n  <br/>\n  dazzleing gleam, will o wisp, dark types will walk all over banette without dazzling gleam\n </p>\n <p>\n  linoone@ whatever item it picks up ability -pick up\n  <br/>\n  free items including

</p>\n <p>\n  linoone can be subbed out for zangoose or seviper that are both really good in game\n </p>\n <p>\n  zangoose@toxic orb is good but you wont have it so silk scarf abilty will be immunity but it gets toxic boost , ha\n  <br/>\n  moveset\n  <br/>\n  return/fa\u00e7ade stab move\n  <br/>\n  close combat, great move\n  <br/>\n  swords dance is good\n  <br/>\n  rock slide/aerial ace/ x-scizzor/shadow claw rock slide to help with the\n flying weakness early on in the game and aerial ace for fighting types,\n x scissor for another good move buy because this is in game shadow claw\n is the best option, for competive quick attack\n </p>\n <p>\n  seviper@ don't know\n  <br/>\n  seviper can be a good mixed attacker but has the physical advantage with coil\n  <br/>\n  coil, set up

With STAB, Flare blitz becomes 180 power, Sky uppercut \nand Blaze Kick both become 127.5 power (rounded to 125).

I \nwould like ideas for other possible moves, if anyone has any. Mega \nGardevoir also has the Ability Pixilate, which makes all normal type \nmoves Fairy Type AND gives them a 30% boost which brings Hyper Voice to \n175.5 power or 220.5 if it's super effective which is insane!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mightyena @Choice Scarf/Quick Claw\n  <br/>\n  Ability: Intimidate\n  <br/>\n  -Ice Fang\n  <br/>\n  -Crunch\n  <br/>\n  -Take down\n  <br/>\n  -Assurance/Thief/Rock Smash\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mightyena is insanely strong with the STAB Crunch but the other moves\n are slightly disappointing. I easily wipe Pheobe of the E4's team with \nthe Crunch. Not sure of any replacements, but I am thinking Thief/Snarl \nwould be good to replace assurance because both the items on Mightyena \nincrease speed, making Assurance practically useless.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Torterra @ Soft Sand/Miracle Seed/Yache Berry\n  <br/>\n  Ability: Overgrow\n  <br/>\n  -Wood Hammer\n  <br/>\n  -Crunch\n  <br/>\n  -Razor Leaf/Synthesis\n  <br/>\n  -Earthquake\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing much to say about this set except that it is your best bet against Electric types.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Feraligatr @Sea Incense/Wacan Berry\n  <br/>\n  Ability: Torrent\n  <br/>\n  -Crunch\n  <br/>\n  -Strength\n  <br/>\n  -Aqua Tail/Hydro Pump\n  <br/>\n  -Waterfall\n </p>\n <p>\n  Feraligatr's Attack Stat is higher than his Sp.Atk stat so I would \nrecommend running Aqua Tail over Hydro Pump unless you are confident \nenough to deal with the accuracy and have a +Sp.Atk nature. Strength and\n Crunch are optional, if you find anything better please tell me but \nwaterfall is a must. I'm sure it is the 2nd strongest physical water \nmove behind aqua tail.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ludicolo @Amulet Coin/Mystic Water/ Miracle Seed\n  <br/>\n  Ability: Rain Dish\n  <br/>\n  -Fake Out/Giga Drain\n  <br/>\n  -Ice Beam/Blizzard\n  <br/>\n  -Surf/Hydro Pump\n  <br/>\n  -Rain dance\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ludicolo is usually called a useless Pokemon or unworthy or even \nbeing a Pokemon, but this set for Ludicolo works well. As flying is a \nbig weakness for the team (Torterra, Ludicolo and Blaziken and even \nsometimes Gardevoir because of Crobat), I have given Ludicolo ice beam. I\n do recommend it over blizzard as blizzard has terrible accuracy. My \nLudicolo is lvl88 and currently packs fake out, ice beam, surf and rain \ndance. Easily destroys some of the E4's beasts like Salamence, Altaria, \nShiftry and Mandibuzz with a simple Fake Out/Ice beam combo or you can \ntake care of Pokemon like Pheobe's Chandelure and Mega Sableye with a \nRain dance/Surf combo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thank you for reading this... if you did or No thanks for skipping to\n the end.

Since you have an actually good grass type, selecting your \nelectric type really isn't that important, so you could just teach \nThunderbolt to a non-Electric type. Mega Altaria will serve as your \nflying type. I equipped her with mostly physical attacks because they \nare not affected by Draco Meteor. Since Pixilate converts moves to \nFairy, Altaria's Take Down gets STAB. Camerupt is our fire type, strong \nagainst many of Metagross's attacks. So, he'll be perfect to use in the \nfinal battle against Steven - and in a team replete with medium slow and\n slow levelling rates, having a medium fast Pokemon is great. Sandslash \nis our ground type, and supposed to balance out against most fire and \npoison types. Crawdaunt is our water type. Give him Surf for HM and Ice \nBeam for Dragon types. He learns Crunch - teach it to him at all costs \ndue to both STAB and coverage against Phoebe's ghost Pokemon. And \nlastly, we have Sceptile. The good thing is that he has wonderful Sp \nAttack and decent attack. The problem is that most of his coverage moves\n are physical, so you just have to make the most of it with Dual Chop, \nLeaf Blade, and Swords Dance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With Torchic, you need water, grass, and dark to deal with rock, \nground, fairy, water, and psychic. It's also incredibly important who \nyou use as your electric type. This makes Magnezone a perfect fit. \nFlygon triples as a rock type (okay, he's really a ground type), a \nFlyer, and a dragon type. Give him Fly, Dragon Claw, Earthquake, and \nRock Slide (no need for Crunch, and you'll see why). Sharpedo has \nextremely good attack (despite his pathetic poor defenses), and I would \nrecommend teaching it Surf since it isn't too bad of a move for his \nspecial attack. Beautifly is here to serve as a high-powered special \nattacker, and so is Gardevoir. Both Beautifly and Gardevoir will learn \nEnergy Ball as both these guys have better coverage moves than grass \ntypes. And even though Beautifly is really weak to Rock types, it has \nthe speed and special attack to OHKO most of em in one hit. And I'm \nteaching Blaziken one special move because Metagross won't go down in \none hit even from a supereffective physical move. I also threw Beautifly\n in here to speed up the leveling process.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With Mudkip, your primary concern is grass. So, a poison type could \nwork well - enter Roselia and Sludge Bomb. She doubles as a grass type. \nSalamence is probably your best bet here as a fire type (Even though \nit's dragon and flying) since he's so versatile. A Flamethrower from \nSalamence will do lots of damage to Steven's team. The problem with him \nis that he appears so late in the game, but he's worthwhile all the \nsame. Heracross is quite useful as a fighting type due to power and \nspeed. Aggron is here to neutralize weaknesses to grass, and give him \nSturdy so he can survive Focus Blast or Earth Power. Cosplay Pikachu is \nhere because you get him quite early in the game, and although he can't \nevolve or anything, he gets a special move (which gets powered up by a \nfree Light Ball on route 120). But this move HAS to be Icicle Crash to \ndeal with ground - otherwise you may as well teach him a regular move. \nAnd lastly, Swampert. Mega Evolve him so that his Surf and Ice Beam \nattacks actually do damage. I normally would be suggesting Ice Punch and\n Aqua Tail instead of Surf and Ice Beam, but you can't get Ice Punch \nbefore the Pokemon League, so Ice Beam will have to do for now.

Get an old rod in Dewford and go fish off the \ncoast. Has a pretty standard Gyarados moveset but i'll explain just \nincase.\n  <br/>\n  -Waterfall-&gt; Possibly the best physical water type attack in my opinion plus it gains stab and serves as an HM.\n  <br/>\n  (Aqua Tail could be an alternative if that's a preference)\n  <br/>\n  -Ice Fang-&gt; This is more of a filler move and works great against \nDrakes' dragon types except for kingdra. Learns it early on and fairly \npowerful and can cause flinching, or freeze them.\n  <br/>\n  -Dragon Dance-&gt; This is what makes Gyarados extremely dangerous. Drop\n one or two of these and he becomes a well rounded sweeper, being able \nto take out most types.\n  <br/>\n  -Earthquake-&gt; This is your coverage move against his main weakness, \nelectric, but is also just a good move to have on your Pokemon.\n  <br/>\n  <strong>\n   DISCLAIMER:\n  </strong>\n  Only use gyarados against electric types or\n anything you suspect to have an electric move on if you have at least \none dragon dance because a lot of electric type Pokemon are fast.\n  <br/>\n  ITEM: Focus Sash\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   AGGRON\n  </strong>\n  comes in as the Physically defensive tank on \nthis team. Only thing to really keep it away from are fighting and \nground types as they are 4x effective. However, Aggron and his evolution\n line pretty can pretty much tank and work through most of the gyms such\n as Mauville's, Petalburg's, and Fortree's.\n  <br/>\n  -Stone Edge-&gt; Good stab attack that packs a lot of power. Only issue \nis that it may not hit when you really need it to due to its lower \naccuracy. If reliability is what you're looking for then just change it \nto rock slide.\n  <br/>\n  -Heavy Slam-&gt; Aggron is one of the heaviest Pokemon in the game. Plus heavy slam is steel so it gains stab.\n  <br/>\n  -Earthquake-&gt; once again a pretty good move to have and it just seems right.\n  <br/>\n  -Iron Defense-&gt; Honestly, Aggron already has a high defense stat, but\n if you throw up 2 or 3 of these, you will be able to shrug off even a \nclose combat or an earthquake.\n  <br/>\n  ITEM: Aggronite\n </p>\n <p>\n  Never mind Gallade, because there's already a fighting type, throw\n  <strong>\n   GARDEVOIR\n  </strong>\n  on there. Although I would highly recommend a Gallade on any team that \nneeds a fighting type, Gardevoir has it's advantages. It serves as your \nstrong fairy type and a good psychic type that makes this team fairly \nwell rounded.\n  <br/>\n  -Moonblast-&gt; Stab and there's a chance it reduces Sp. Atk. by one stage. Overall just a great move\n  <br/>\n  -Psychic-&gt; Also stab and it takes care of those pesky poison types \nwhile also having a chance to reduce the targets' Sp. Def. stat by one \nstage.\n  <br/>\n  -Shadow Ball-&gt; Filler move that helps against other psychic types\n  <br/>\n  -Calm Mind-&gt; This turns Gardevoir into an all out boss. Even just one\n of these dials up Gardevoir's power and makes it an extremely lethal \nspecial attacker.\n  <br/>\n  ITEM: Gardevoirite\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   RAICHU\n  </strong>\n  is the electric type on this team and adds a \ntouch of speed other than Blaziken. Although Raichu is only available \nafter you deal with Kyogre/Groudon, it levels up pretty quickly and if \nyou use the PokeFinder to find one with thunderpunch, you're all set.\n  <br/>\n  -ThunderPunch-&gt; Obviously a great Physical electric move, better than spark in my opinion.\n  <br/>\n  (This can be swapped for Wild Charge if you want your Raichu to pack a little extra punch at the price of recoil)\n  <br/>\n  -Thunder Wave-&gt; This is mainly for capturing Pokemon and slowing down any opponents that may still be faster than you.\n  <br/>\n  -Brick Break-&gt; Filler move and is just a good way to deal with Normal, Rock, or Dark Types.\n  <br/>\n  -Agility-&gt; Allows Raichu to become even faster.\n  <br/>\n  ITEM: Light Ball\n </p>\n <p>\n  So I'm a firm believer that every great team needs a dragon type. \nThat's just how I am. They're just overall strong Pokemon and can sweep \nwhole teams if the opponent isn't careful. In this case the dragon type \nis none other than\n  <strong>\n   SALAMENCE.\n  </strong>\n  The moveset is fairly similar to my Dragonite's in generations 1 and 2.\n  <br/>\n  -Dragon Dance-&gt; Allows Salamence to get faster and pretty much sets him up for a sweep.\n  <br/>\n  -Dragon Claw-&gt; Great dragon move, gains stab, and in competitive, \nit's less likely that they switch into a fairy type because its much \nless predictable than outrage. But salamence can't even learn outrage so\n that's fine.\n  <br/>\n  (Dragon Rush is the replacement if you want just a bit more power, but it's not always reliable as it has 75 accuracy.)\n  <br/>\n  -Earthquake-&gt; Coverage move. Gets rid of those rock types that it's weak too.\n  <br/>\n  -Fire Fang-&gt; Also a coverage move that, after a few dragon dance's, will destroy any ice type Pokemon.\n  <br/>\n  ITEM: Salamencite\n </p>\n <p>\n  Well, that's my team and it has worked pretty well for me, in-game \nand competitively. Sorry it was a long post but I feel it would be best \nto justify the reasoning behind my choices. In-game I always try and use\n Hm Slaves so that way I dont have to waste a move slot for them. Just \nswitch out the Pokemon(s) that are the least useful at the time of the \ngame. Anyway, if anyone has any comments or suggestions to make I would \nbe glad to hear them.\n </p>\n</div>\n",

Magical Leaf is compensation\nfor the lack of a Grass type.\n\nSwellow\n\nMoveset:  \nAerial Ace  \nAir Slash  \nFly  \nSteel Wing\n\nAerial Ace and Air Slash are good STAB moves with their own advantages: Aerial\nAce never misses and Air Slash can cause flinching. Fly is an HM, a strong\nSTAB move, and on the turn you use it most attacks can't hit you. Steel Wing\nis coverage against Rock and Ice types.\n\nManectric\n\nMoveset:  \nThunder/Thunderbolt  \nDischarge  \nThunder Fang  \nStrength\n\nThunder, Thunderbolt, Discharge and Thunder Fang are all strong STAB moves\nthat can cause paralysis, with Thunder Fang being able to cause flinching. You\ncan pick between Thunder and Thunderbolt, as Thunder is stronger and can be\nlearned naturally, but Thunderbolt has better accuracy, and you can only get\nthe TM for it from Wattson after catching or defeating Groudon(OR) or\nKyogre(AS). Strength is an HM.\n\nSandslash\n\nMoveset:  \nBulldoze  \nDig  \nEarthquake  \nCut\n\nThe first three are all strong STAB moves with their own advantages: Bulldoze\ncan slow the enemy down, Dig is an HM and on the turn you use it most attacks\ncan't hit you, and Earthquake can hit underground enemies. Cut is an HM.\n\nSharpedo\n\nMoveset:  \nCrunch  \nSurf  \nWaterfall  \nIce Fang/Poison Fang\n\nCrunch is a strong STAB move that can weaken the enemy's special defense. Surf\nand Waterfall are also strong STAB moves, as well as HMs. Ice Fang and Poison\nFang are coverage moves that can cause flinching. You can either use Ice Fang\njust to cover against Grass types, as well as compensation for the lack of an\nIce type, and can also cause freezing, or use Poison Fang as coverage for both\nGrass and Fairy types, as well as being able to cause poisoning.\n\nThanks for reading and tell me in the comments what you think of this team.\n\n",

For the last moveslot, you can go with \nAerial Ace for convenience, Air Slash for flinches, Brave Bird for \npower, U-Turn for scouting, or Roost for recovery.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Camerupt-\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Moves:\n  </em>\n  <br/>\n  Flamethrower\n  <br/>\n  Earthquake/Earth Power\n  <br/>\n  Stone Edge\n  <br/>\n  Flash Cannon/Eruption/Explosion\n </p>\n <p>\n  Flamethrower is STAB. You can use Earthquake or Earth Power for \nGround STAB depending on if you want a physical or special attacking \nGround move. Stone Edge is a really good move that forms the \"EdgeQuake\"\n combo, a combo that has amazing neutral coverage. For the last move, \nyou can use Flash Cannon if you are worried about Fairy types. \nOtherwise, you can go with Eruption for raw power, or Explosion as a \nfinal stand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Sharpedo-\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Moves:\n  </em>\n  <br/>\n  Surf\n  <br/>\n  Crunch/Night Slash/Dark Pulse\n  <br/>\n  Ice Beam/Fang\n  <br/>\n  Waterfall/Dive/Poison Fang/Poison Jab/Scald/Aqua Jet\n </p>\n <p>\n  Surf is STAB, and extremely necessary in Hoenn, which is as watery as\n it was in Generation III. Crunch, Night Slash, or Dark Pulse can be \nused for Dark type STAB. Ice Beam or Ice Fang can be used for coverage. \nFor the last move, Waterfall is a pretty good move since Sharpedo has a \nreally high Attack stat, and Waterfall is a physical move in the \nRuby/Sapphire remakes. Dive could also be used if you want. Poison Fang \nor Poison Jab can be used to counter Fairies. Scald can be used if you \nwant to play around with a chance of burning the opponent. Aqua Jet is a\n good priority move, and can be pretty nice to have.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Pikachu-\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Moves:\n  </em>\n  <br/>\n  Thunderbolt\n  <br/>\n  Wild Charge/Charge Beam/Volt Switch\n  <br/>\n  Brick Break/Grass Knot/Hidden Power\n  <br/>\n  Thunder Wave\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you are wondering why it says Pikachu instead of Raichu, it's \nbecause the Light Ball is extremely easy to find in ORAS. With the Light\n Ball, Pikachu hits as hard as Legendary Pokemon! Plus, I like Pikachu a\n lot more than Raichu, so that's what I'm recommending. Thunderbolt is \nSTAB. Wild Charge or Volt Switch can be used for secondary STAB, or you \ncan go with Charge Beam to buff up even more. For coverage, you can use \nBrick Break, Grass Knot, or Hidden Power (Water or Ice ideally). Thunder\n Wave rounds out the set since it is a phenominal status move, one of, \nif not the best, in the entire game.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Zangoose-\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   Moves:\n  </em>\n  <br/>\n  Return\n  <br/>\n  Shadow Claw\n  <br/>\n  Close Combat\n  <br/>\n  Swords Dance/X-Scissor/Aerial Ace/Poison Jab\n </p>\n <p>\n  Return is STAB.

It is just an amazing Pokemon overall. It can be found on Route 1\n as your starter. Blaziken can learn Flare Blitz and High Jump Kick at \nlevel 1 and they are two STAB moves with incredible power. Brave Bird is\n a good coverage move for Blaziken in general for killing Bug,Fighting, \nand Grass-type Pokemon. You're probably going to say that Flare Blitz \ncan also defeat Bug and Grass-type Pokemon. But, can it defeat Fighting \ntypes for super effective damage? It is learned at level 50.

Moonblast is learned at level 1 and is a \ngreat STAB Fairy-type move. Psychic is a great Psychic-type STAB move \nand can be learned once you hit level 30 for Kirlia (which is the level \nit evolves) or it can be learned at level 31 as a Gardevoir. Thunderbolt\n is a good filler move, which can be found at Mauville Hills after the \nNew Mauville events.

It is only 1 out of 3 Pokemon\n with a \"unique evolution\" on this team by evolving it with a Shiny \nStone that can be found on Route 123. Energy Ball is a TM you can get in\n the Safari Zone, but you need to have both the Acro Bike and the Mach \nBike to do so. Also, another team member can be found at the Safari Zone\n later on. Sludge Bomb is a TM that can be found at Dewford Town at the \nlargest house by talking to a Pokemon Collector. Dazzling Gleam is a TM \nyou can get on the other side of Route 123 by defeating a Fairy-Tale \nGirl.

It can be found as a little \nSwablu on Route 119 near Meteor Falls. Dragon Pulse is a STAB move that \ncan be learned at level 40. Moonblast is a coverage move to get over its\n Dragon weakness. But if it is a Mega Altaria it is a STAB move. \nFlamethrower is a TM that is coverage against Ice-Types and can be found\n at Victory Road. And Fly is an HM you get at Route 119 from your rival \nwhich is STAB and another team member can be found on Route 119 right \nafter this one.

It can be found on Route 119 as a Feebas by \nfishing. It has 2 \"unique evolutions\" because you can trade a Feebas \nholding a Prism Scale or you can use Pokeblocks to max out its Beauty \nstat. DO NOT TRADE IT USING A PRISM SCALE! Just evolve it using \nPokeblocks. Surf is a STAB HM that can be found in Petalburg City from \nWally's Uncle after defeating Norman. Ice Beam is a coverage TM that can\n be found at Sea Mauville. Dive is a STAB HM that can be found at \nMossdeep City in the Drought/Drizzle scene.

The moment I\n saw it I instantly fell in love with it because it is soooooo \nKawaii-Desu or cute. It can be found in the Safari Zone on Route 121 \nafter getting the national dex from Prof. Birch after the battle between\n you and Kyogre/Groudon. It has a \" unique evolution\" because it evolves\n with high friendship, so I suggest getting a Soothe Bell because it'll \ndo the trick. Return is a STAB move that can be learned at level 1 or as\n a TM in Pacifidlog Town in Post-Game but we don't want to get it so \nlate so just teach it via move relearner. High Jump Kick is a STAB move \nfor Mega-Lopunny that can be learned on level 66 but just go to the move\n relearner for it too. Ice Beam is a coverage move for Mega-Lopunny for \nit's flying weakness that's a TM that can be found at Sea Mauville. You \nmight be like Lopunny isn't a special attacker but I don't wanna put Ice\n Punch on it because it is an egg move but I know you can get that move \nvia DexNav so you can put it on if you want. And Strength is a HM that \ncan be found at Route 112 given to you by your rival.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So, that's my team I hope you like it! Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire \nare amazing games and I got Alpha Sapphire just recently because I have \nbeen living under a rock all this time (It's a joke I don't live under a\n rock really).
