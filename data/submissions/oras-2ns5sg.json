I just caught a Vulpix I want to use, and later on I'd like to use a Froslass. Taking a break from playing for now until I decide what to do.",

        "I did my first play though with an all grass team. Septile, Ludicolo, Shiftry, Cradily, Breeloom, and Tropius it was pretty fun.\n\nNow I'm doing a more balanced team. So far I have Combusken, Aron, Electrike,  Swellow, and Mightyena. I'm thinking about Kindgra for my final slot but I may replace Swellow with something as I continue. \n",

        "I'm using my personal favourites, and since I like competitive play but nothing above UU really, I based my team around RU.\nSo I can't really win with any of the starters cause they all to OP so they will all be OU, so I just went all out with Mega Blaziken (I didn't use mine in X)\nThen I have a Cacturne, and a Wailord for the rest of my core (Grass, Fire, Water)\nThen I thought \"I need 1 more Mega\" and my favourite pokemon JUST SO HAPPENED to have a Mega! So I have a Mega Banette (I almost jizzed myself when u said u were considering using banette)\nThen I thought \"I need 2 walls. 1 Physical and 1 Special.\" so I went and picked up a Xatu and a Probopass! \nThat's my team :)"

I'm also considering Milotic, Banette, and Roserade. I'm just using pokemon I like, with no thought to any kind of competitive team building since I don't think it's necessary for playing the main story. What's your in game team?",
